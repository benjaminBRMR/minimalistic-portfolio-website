# Minimalistic Portfolio Website

With the minimalist website, I wanted to work more with flex in order to understand it better. 

I also decided not to continue learning scss, as css is simply much more widespread and I can quickly get help there. 

Also, this website is for educational purposes only and is inspired by the design of this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKNvTxWOdKw&ab_channel=Bedimcode.
